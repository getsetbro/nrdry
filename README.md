I really don't want to use an actual TABLE for this site nav but there is no other way to get the spacing that is required from the PSD file. I mean I coould use display:table in CSS if this page didnt need to support oldIE. The customer won't care what the code looks like.
The other option shown in the PSD and give all the nav elements the same percent of the site width which is around 16% for this number of nav items. But that doesnt perform as well in RWD as the TABLE layout.


I am not saying there is no way to make this background image centered and scrollable and always fill the screen and work in oldIE but I am saying there is no GOOD WAY of doing it. It is not worth it. I am going with progressive enhancement, the newer browsers get the best experience.
